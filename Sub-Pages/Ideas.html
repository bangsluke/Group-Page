				<div><h4>Football Drinking Game</h4>
				<p>
				- Online Web tool where a person can pick two teams, select how many people they have playing, the app loads in the line ups and randomly assigns an equal number of players to each person. Then whilst game is playing and goals go in, the web app displays who has scored and therefore who gets to nominate a drink etc.
				- Allow the user to specifiy the rules they want, like half a beer for a goal etc.
				</p>
				</div>

				<div><h4>Golf Page</h4>
				<p>
				- Online golf tips page where I can convert my Google Docs notes (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pUjRwTfvBprdzqo6_xdlduA21RurrJgaRfDDT6EWXgg/edit) onto a Website.
				- Have an API looking into the Grint to get my latest round summaries and my handicap?
