							Rather than manual update. - When the data is real live data
							from a API, add an audio clip to the website that plays "AND
							IT'S LIVE" when the user picks that stat. - For each stats
							table, pass three hex codes for styling table? E.g. yellow,
							green and white for Dorkinians. - Create a Google Doc of all
							Dorkinians stats and link from Group Page to that document for
							Tits members. - Consider changing the last two drop downs to be
							hidden by CSS and add later on? - Consider adding a sort
							dropdown? - For each onchange action, highlight the next drop
							down into focus to guide the user. - Change the called function
							from each drop down selection: - Third one just highlights the
							relevant header cell? - Last one shows the filtered data. - Set
							up a morning automation script that gets all various API data by
							calling all other API functions.

							Ideas for stats: - [DONE]. Tennis - [DONE]. Mollky - [DONE].
							Perudo - Spike ball. -- Dorkinians Stats (add hover over
							information pop ups to explain what each column is). --- Top
							scorer table (with minutes per goal). --- Top assists table
							(with minutes per assist). --- Top clean sheets (with games per
							clean sheet). --- Most ODs wins. -- COD kills/wins and time
							spent etc. -- COD alcoholic shots completed. Dom to count all
							videos for each user in Whatsapp group. -- Fantasy score and
							historical scores -- All time Fantasy point scorer. -- Most said
							phrases in Tits whatsapp group. Most messaged etc. -- Best 5km
							and 10km time. -- [DONE]. Add a cricket table including famous
							cricket players to ensure only Dom getting Titan. -- [DONE]. Add
							Footgolf. - Add terrible shouts (Oli: Adama Traore being the
							most unstoppable player in the prem, Diego Costa to flop, Werner
							to be worldie, Kieran: Can't see Gundogan continuing this
							scoring, Jon: Rolando Aarons fantasy pick, Andy: Emre Can most
							complete midfielder, Alex: Ozil to Fenerbache, Luke: Peter
							Crouch bad at headers - Shots owed: Alex & Ali owe a double shot
							after losing to Dom and Luke in a the final 2 v2 Cod match on
							the evening of February 25/02/2021.

					<h3>Major Ideas</h3>

					<div>
						<h4>Football Drinking Game</h4>
						<p>
							- Online Web tool where a person can pick two teams, select how
							many people they have playing, the app loads in the line ups and
							randomly assigns an equal number of players to each person. Then
							whilst game is playing and goals go in, the web app displays who
							has scored and therefore who gets to nominate a drink etc. -
							Allow the user to specifiy the rules they want, like half a beer
							for a goal etc.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h4>Golf Page</h4>
						<p>
							- Online golf tips page where I can convert my Google Docs notes
							(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pUjRwTfvBprdzqo6_xdlduA21RurrJgaRfDDT6EWXgg/edit)
							onto a Website. - Have an API looking into the Grint to get my
							latest round summaries and my handicap? - Live table of shot
							distances from the Google Sheets file.
